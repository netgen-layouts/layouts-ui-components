          Eating carbs for breakfast and lunch gives me more cravings the rest
          of the day: especially for more carbs. Dinnertime carbs don’t matter
          much, because I’m winding down at that point of the day, and cravings
          will soon be precluded by sleep. Eliminating mid-day cravings has made
          it easier to eat in greater moderation. As a result, I’ve slowly but
          steadily lost weight since starting to do this. And since I’m not
          cutting out carbs totally, I’m avoiding the “no-carb flu” symptoms
          (massive fatigue, brain fog, and headaches) that hit me like a ton of
          bricks when I first adopted the ketogenic diet for a short time (and
          lost a lot of weight as a result) back in January.
